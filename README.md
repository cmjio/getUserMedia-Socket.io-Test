GetUserMedia & Socket.io Experiment
=======

This was a very early test of using socket.io to stream getUserMedia, created in 2012 when getUserMedia was first released on google chrome canary.  Results were achieved but should not be used in production.  If you wish to stream getUserMedia look at a Peer connection in the HTML5 apis.  An example would be Peerjs.com.
